# Pronobo

We have developed a sports match prediction system designed to automate the analysis and prediction of match outcomes for different football leagues ( Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, Serie A, Bundesliga). 
Our platform integrates a prediction algorithm and a user-friendly interface, suitable for both amateur and professional bettors, with the goal of helping them optimize their bets and maximize their winnings.
The project follows a detailed execution plan comprising various stages, from data collection to platform maintenance. Ultimately, the project aims to provide a comprehensive and usable solution, offering favorable prospects in terms of improving prediction accuracy and user satisfaction.
